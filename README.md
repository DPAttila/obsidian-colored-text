# Obsidian Colored Text Plugin

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for adding colored texts to your notes.

> This plugin is still in development. Features implemented and the way to use them is not final. Any suggestion regarding to those is appriciated.

## Features

- There are 5 slots for storing colors and those can be seen in status bar 
- You can switch between slots, either by going forward or backwards, by using keyboard shortcuts
- You can change the current slot's color by openning color input menu, also by using shortcut
- You can change the color of the selected text into current color slot also by using keyboard shortcut

## Usage

Right now there are 4 commands available:
- Change color of selected text
- Switch between slots, forward
- Switch between slots, backwards
- Color input

I suggest using hotkeys for these commands as I designed this plugin with a keyboard-centric approach.
